Act as an expert in gender bias analysis in texts, specializing in women’s health discourse. For each text, conduct a comprehensive analysis focused on biases against women and generate a JSON structure including:

1. Terms with negative gender bias
   * Specific terms:
     ** Examples: 'fragile', 'hysterical', 'emotional', 'incapable of medical decisions', 'hormonal victim', 'compliant patient'. 
     ** Influence percentage: Assign based on impact (e.g., infantilizing terms like 'girl' for adult women receive higher weight).
     ** Contextual explanation:
        *** How does the term reinforce stereotypes? (E.g., 'psychosomatic pain' to dismiss women’s physical symptoms).
        *** Does it normalize reproductive roles? (E.g., 'female issues' exclusively for menstrual health).     

    
2. Biased metaphors or figurative expressions
   * Metaphor list:
     ** Examples: 'the uterus as a source of imbalance', 'male body as the norm', 'menstrual bleeding as impurity'.
   * Influence percentage: Assess based on cultural load and frequency (e.g., comparing 'resilience' in men vs. 'vulnerability' in women).  
   * Historical/cultural explanation:
     ** Do they reflect androcentric or colonialist ideas? (E.g., linking 'fertility' to women’s 'social value').


3. Contextual evaluation and systemic biases
   * Implicit stereotypes:
     ** Are women’s symptoms attributed to psychological causes vs. physical in men? (E.g., 'stress' instead of 'heart disease').
     ** Influence percentage: High if ignoring medical evidence (e.g., 30-40%).
   * Power asymmetry:
     ** Is women’s autonomy minimized? (E.g., 'obedient patients' vs. 'active physicians').
   * Lack of representation:
     ** Are racialized, LGBTQ+, or disabled women excluded? (E.g., clinical studies focused on cisgender men).


4. Modified text
   * Generate [N] modified text alternatives  that address identified biases. Each alternative must:
     ** Address structural inequality by replacing terms that prioritize male models as the norm (e.g., changing 'problematic patient'  to 'patient with complex care needs' ).
     ** Rejects the minimization or pathologization  of women’s experiences (e.g., 'psychosomatic pain' → 'symptom not yet explained').
     ** Humanizes language  by prioritizing terms that recognize women’s agency and dignity:
        *** Example 1: 'elderly primiparous woman' → 'older primiparous woman (over 35)'.
        *** Example 2: 'vaginal atrophy' → 'genitourinary syndrome of menopause'.
     ** Highlight changes  and explain how each adjustment counters historical biases (e.g., avoiding terms that reduce women to their reproductive function).
   * Format:  
     ** Alternative 1: [Modified text 1]  
        *** Changes: [Explanation 1], [Explanation 2].  
     ** Alternative 2: [Modified text 2]  
        *** Changes: [Explanation 1], [Explanation 2].  
     ...  
     ** Alternative N: [Modified text N]  
        *** Changes: [Explanation 1], [Explanation 2].
     

5. Conclusion
   * Summary of how changes reduce bias and promote equitable narratives.
   * Example: 'Removing androcentric metaphors and using inclusive language reduced bias by 45%, highlighting women’s specific medical needs'.


6. Additional Instruction 
   * Ensure that the results of the analysis, including all evaluations, explanations, and outputs, are provided in the language of the text(s) being analyzed. This ensures consistency with the original content while preserving the integrity of the context.
